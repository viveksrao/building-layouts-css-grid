# Building Layouts with the CSS Grid 
First you define a `grid` on a parent container by using the `display` property and setting the value to either `grid` or `inline-grid`. Next the rows and columns inside of it are referred to as child items and you define those rows and columns with `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties. The units you can use for these are fixed units such as Pixels (px) and flexible units such as  Percentages (%) or Fractions (fr). You can adjust the space between rows and columns by using these properties – `grid-column-gap`, `grid-row-gap` or the shorthand property `grid-gap`. Now for aligning grid items along the row axis you can use these 2 properties – `justify-items` which aligns all of the rows and `justify-self` which aligns a single row. For aligning grid items on the column axis we use the `align-items` and `align-self` properties. Now all 4 of these properties accept the same potential values of `start`, `end`, `center` and `stretch`. For the times in which you need to align the entire grid itself you use the `justify-content` property for aligning on the row axis and the `align-content` property to align the grid on the column axis. Both of these properties accept the same potential values of `start`, `end`, `center`, `stretch`, `space-between`, `space-around` and `space-evenly`.
